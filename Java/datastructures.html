	<h1>Theory: Data structures</h1>

a data structure is a collection of elements containing data, the relationships among them, and the operations that can be applied to the data.
some common data structures:
<ul> 
	<li>array</li>
	<li>linked list</li>
	<li>hash table</li>
	<li> various trees (binary search tree, heap, red-black tree, B-tree, etc).</li>
</ul>
data structures are used to effectively organize and manage data in programs.
<h2>Abstract Data Structures</h2>
<p>Abstract Data Type is an abstract type which is defined by a value and a set of possible operations (behavior) from the point of view of a user of the data. Abstract data type (ADT) hides a specific data structure, providing only a well-defined set of operations necessary for the user-programmer.

There are some common data structures that every trained programmer should know: 
<ul>
	<li>stack</li>
	<li>queue</li>
	<li>priority queue</li>
	<li>map (or dictionary)</li> 
	<li>set</li> 
	 As a rule, modern programming languages like Java, Python, C++ provides them in standard libraries for use in new programs.
</ul>

</p>

Recursion:
recursion in programming is when a function calls itself.
Each recursive function consists of the following steps:
<ul>
      <li><p><b>A trivial base case</b>  stops the recursion. This is the case we know the result for. For example, if we find a doll we can’t open, we take it and proudly state: “that it’s our smallest doll!”</p></li>
      <li><p><b>A reduction step</b> gets us from the current problem to a simpler one.</p></li>
</ul>
recursion is usually slower and less memory-efficient, but it saves the developers' time.
